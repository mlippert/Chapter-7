				<p>Stereoisomerism is not restricted to carbon, although it is rightly given the most attention when inspecting for stereogenic centers in organic structures. Elements other than carbon also have this capability. The second most prevalent element to display stereoisomerism is nitrogen. This is followed by sulfur, phosphorous, and silicon, but these all occupy distant positions compared with nitrogen.</p>

				<p style="color:blue;">TIP: Organic chemists normally refer to multivalent atoms other than carbon as heteroatoms. When you see this term, the elements nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur should be first in mind.</p>

				<p style="color:blue;">NOTE: You may be wondering about oxygen as a potential stereocenter. The equivalency of the two lone pairs guarantees that oxygen will not be a stereocenter.</p>

				<p>Nitrogen commonly functions as a stereogenic center paralleling, according to its hybridization, what was seen for carbon. If sp2 hybridized, it parallels the stereoisomerism described for alkenes. The lone pair is considered one of the substituents. Oximes, imines, and azo compounds are representative.</p>

		<div class="row-fluid">
			<div class="span6 leftCol">
				
				<p>Nitrogen that is sp3-hybridized has the potential to be a stereocenter analogous to asymmetric carbon. For an amine, it is a requirement that the three substituents about the nitrogen are different, with the lone pair serving as the fourth substituent. However, it will be seen later in the chapter that certain conditions must be met for amines to maintain their stereochemically stability. Lastly, ammonium salts also parallel asymmetric carbons provided that all four substituents are different. In both of these cases the nitrogen is referred to as an asymmetric center or asymmetric nitrogen.</p>

		<div class="row-fluid">
			<div class="span6 leftCol">
				
				<p>Phosphorus and sulfur are also encountered as stereocenters, but with far less frequency compared with carbon and nitrogen. Two examples are worth mentioning. Trivalent phosphorous models amines in that it hosts three substituents and a lone pair. Phosphorous is stereogenic provided that these three substituents are different. Likewise, sulfonium salts are stereocenters for those cases where it possesses three different substituents.</p>

				<p>Stereocenters are not limited to tetrahedral or trigonal planar geometries. For example, the platinum compound shown is square planar, yet reversal of two of its ligands results in a stereoisomer. This example, which contains no carbon, is also a reminder that stereoisomerism is not limited to organic compounds. The compound on the left, cisplatin, is an anti-tumor agent. Its stereoisomer, transplatin, is not effective against cancer and is toxic.</p>

				<p>Stereoisomerism in the context of organic chemistry permits us to focus solely on trigonal planar and tetrahedral geometries. Geometries associated with transition metal complexes (such as square planar, octahedral, square pyramidal) will only make exceptionally rare appearances for the rest of our study of organic chemistry. The importance of the concept of stereoisomerism remains.</p>
				
				<p><b>Worked Example 7.1.5 Identifying Stereocenters</b></p>
				
				<p>Identify all stereocenters in the following molecules.</p>
				
				<div id="picture4"></div>
				
				<p>The chlorine-bearing carbon is the next position to inspect. Switching two groups results in a stereoisomer. It does not matter which two groups are selected. Here, the hydrogen and chlorine were swapped, but the same result would occur if it were the methyl and vinyl, the methyl and hydrogen, or the hydrogen and vinyl.</p>

				<p style="color:blue;">[INTERACTIVE: TOGGLE (adjusts the visual display of info): Provide the option to toggle on/off the hydrogen on the carbon with the Cl.]</p>
